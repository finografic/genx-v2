Yes — **technically you’re right**.
Your wrapper package _could_ mutate the consumer repo.

The key question is **not “can it?”**, but **“should it, given your goals?”**
Let’s answer that precisely and unemotionally.

---

## 1️⃣ Yes, you _can_ mutate on install (mechanically)

From a purely technical standpoint, you could:

- add a `postinstall` script
- detect absence of `dprint.jsonc`
- generate it
- maybe even pin the exact installed version

Example (not recommended, but real):

```json
"scripts": {
  "postinstall": "node scripts/init-dprint-config.mjs"
}
```

This would:

- run on install
- write files into the consumer repo
- “just work”

So you’re **not wrong**.

---

## 2️⃣ Why this is still the _wrong_ layer

The reason to avoid this has **nothing to do with dprint limitations**
and everything to do with **ecosystem correctness**.

### Mutating on install breaks these invariants:

#### ❌ 1. Package install should be idempotent

Installing a dependency should not:

- change tracked files
- require a git clean
- introduce side effects

This is a _strong_ expectation in mature tooling.

---

#### ❌ 2. CI becomes ambiguous

In CI:

```bash
pnpm install
```

Now:

- files may be generated
- repo becomes “dirty”
- `git diff` is non-empty
- release pipelines behave differently

That’s subtle, painful, and hard to explain.

---

#### ❌ 3. Upgrades become dangerous

If you mutate on install, then:

```bash
pnpm update @finografic/dprint-config
```

Could:

- rewrite a config file
- silently change formatting rules
- override local edits

That violates user ownership.

---

#### ❌ 4. It violates your own philosophy

You’ve repeatedly stated:

- explicit > implicit
- boring > clever
- no hidden behavior
- easy to explain in an interview

An install-time mutator is the **opposite** of all four.

Even if _you_ document it perfectly, users will still say:

> “Why did installing this package modify my repo?”

That’s a smell.

---

## 3️⃣ The _correct_ place for mutation already exists

This is the most important architectural point:

> **Mutation belongs in a scaffold tool, not a config package.**

You already have one:

```
@finografic/create
```

That tool is:

- explicitly run by a human
- expected to write files
- allowed to ask questions
- allowed to evolve templates

That is where:

- `dprint.jsonc` generation belongs
- version pinning logic belongs
- future migrations belong

Trying to duplicate that behavior in a config package creates overlap and confusion.

---

## 4️⃣ Why ESLint presets “get away with it” (and dprint doesn’t)

This comparison matters.

ESLint presets:

- are loaded dynamically
- run in Node
- are executed at lint-time
- never touch the filesystem

So they _feel_ integrated.

dprint configs:

- are static files
- resolved by path
- deliberately non-executable

Trying to make a dprint config behave like an ESLint preset is a category error.

You already avoided this once — good instinct.

---

## 5️⃣ The _real_ pain you’re trying to avoid (and why it’s smaller than it seems)

You’re worried about:

> “Having to manually create or update a tiny file.”

But in reality:

### Creation

- Happens **once per repo**
- Can be scaffolded
- Takes ~10 seconds manually

### Updates

- **Never required**
- The `extends` path is version-agnostic
- Upgrading the package upgrades behavior automatically

So the ongoing cost is effectively **zero**.

---

## 6️⃣ Clear recommendation (strong, but justified)

**Do not mutate from `@finografic/dprint-config`.**

Instead:

- ✅ Keep the config package **pure**
- ✅ Use `@finografic/create` to generate files
- ✅ Document the 3-line `dprint.jsonc`
- ✅ Treat formatting changes as semver events

This gives you:

- maximum trust
- zero surprises
- perfect CI behavior
- a clean architecture story

---

## 7️⃣ If you _still_ want mutation (last resort)

If you ever decide to allow it, the _only_ defensible option would be:

- an **explicit CLI**:

  ```bash
  pnpm finografic-dprint init
  ```

- never automatic
- never on install
- never implicit

But honestly — you already have a better solution.

---

## Bottom line

You’re correct: **your wrapper _could_ mutate**.
But choosing _not_ to is a sign of architectural maturity, not limitation.

Finish reading the earlier message — it aligns with this conclusion.
When you’re ready, we can:

- lock the **public API surface** of your dprint configs
- define **semver rules for formatting changes**
- design the exact `@finografic/create` generator output

You’re on solid ground.
