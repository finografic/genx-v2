# Release Process

This repository follows a simple, explicit release process.

## Tagging

Releases are tagged using `v`-prefixed semantic versions:

v0.6.0

```md

- Tag name matches the release title
- Tags are created from `main` / `master`
- No custom naming conventions are used

## Release Notes

GitHub Releases are used for human-readable changelogs.

Package publication is handled separately via GitHub Packages.

Release notes may be:
- Written manually for major or minor releases
- Auto-generated by GitHub for patch releases

## Commit History & Diffs

GitHub automatically provides comparison views between tags.

Example:

https://github.com/finografic/react/compare/v0.5.0...v0.6.0

Commits may also be referenced directly in release notes using their SHA:
```

finografic/react@a1b2c3d

```md
No additional tooling or setup is required — tags are the source of truth.
```
